# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a basic **machine learning workflow** using the **Iris dataset** and **Logistic Regression** from `scikit-learn`.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower based on four features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Process

1. **Importing libraries**
2. **Loading and exploring data**
3. **Preprocessing** (splitting into features and labels)
4. **Training** a Logistic Regression model
5. **Making predictions**

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is:
- `Iris.csv` from kaggle
